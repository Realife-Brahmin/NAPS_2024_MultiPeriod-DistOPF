\section{Conclusions}
Aiming toward developing an MPDOPF framework for large distribution grids, this article proposes an ENApp-based spatially distributed multi-period OPF algorithm. The optimization portfolio is developed as a non-convex problem and tested on the IEEE 123 bus test system with four networked areas. The simulation results show that the proposed MPDOPF converges to almost the same global optimum as MPCOPF. However, the solution time for MPCOPF is very high and that also increases exponentially with the increase of study time horizon.
